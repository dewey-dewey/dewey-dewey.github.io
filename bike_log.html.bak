<h2>my bike</h2>

<p>first things first: i <i>love</i> my bike. i ride a fuji espree, made in 1984. i got it in 2011,
from this garage in east lansing, for a non-functioning cheap mountain bike and $50. i love it,
and i rely on it. i also really want a new one!! hopefully, this is the year i will snag <a href="https://surlybikes.com/bikes/ogre">my dream bike</a>. </p>

<h2>bike log</h2>

<p>i commute on my bike pretty regularly, and like to joy ride too! here are some notes.</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>date:</td>
		<td>01.14.21</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>distance:</td>
		<td>15 miles (there and back)
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>conditions:</td>
		<td>low thirties, trail was pretty clear, but def still some ice patches. headwind on the way in, could really feel it.
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>notes:</td>
		<td>got warm pretty quick! first time wearing my winter boots in weather this warm- feels like pushing against the upper limit. also had on wool socks
		and leggings, with my slim dungarees. sunshirt and nanoair jacket up top, with dual layered gloves, a merino buff, and my car talk hat. had to unzip my jacket
		pretty early on. yesterday was my first day back on the bike after a few weeks off, and it certainly <i>felt</i> like i could feel it, though part of that was an
		underinflated tire and a headwind. was running late on my way in, and could feel myself getting annoyed about navigating through the snow and slush and ice. have
		to give myself time to enjoy it!</td>
