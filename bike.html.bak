<h2>my bike</h2>

<p>first things first: i <i>love</i> my bike. i ride a fuji espree, made in 1984. i got it in 2011,
from this garage in east lansing, for a non-functioning cheap mountain bike and $50. i love it,
and i rely on it. i also really want a new one!! hopefully, this is the year i will snag <a href="https://surlybikes.com/bikes/ogre">my dream bike</a>. </p>

<h2>bike log</h2>

<p><i>i commute on my bike pretty regularly, and like to joy ride too! here are some notes.</i></p>

		<td>first time back on after a week of bussing and driving- felt good to move again! hopefully the weather will allow me to keep it up. saw a guy pedaling last friday when we'd just gotten 6" of snow and i was jealous! i'm not set up for that currently, my bike couldn't handle it.</td>

		<td>got pretty warm on the way in, pushing against the wind. took kedzie all the way up til lincoln, where i hopped on the trail. wanted to avoid a potentially icy trail! i think it cut a few minutes off the ride too- a little more direct. will incorporate it into future commutes!</td>

		<td>warmed up quick on my way in, and the way home was sunny and 15 degrees warmer! glad i could swap to just a shell with minimal insulation. chatted with a fella on the way back for a bit- he used to have a similar bike to mine, back when they were new. we talked about riding year round- he's a pleasure rider who won't go below twenty five degrees, and he has electric socks! electric socks! good for him for having a limit and being able to enjoy it. he did say he was pretty cold today while i was actively trying to go slow so i wouldn't sweat, but we were dressed pretty differently. wish my workplace wasn't kept so warm- it gets annoying wearing baselayers to stay warm on my commute, but then being too warm throughout the day. before it got real cold and they cranked the heat, i was comfy dressed in layers!! alas, better this than come cps instances where they have no heat. :( </td>

		<td>tri-purpose ride! i put new <a href="https://www.continental-tires.com/bicycle/tires/urban-tour/ride-tour" title="external link!">tires</a> on my bike, and this was the inagural//test ride.
		they work fine! i feel a little more confident in wintery conditions with some new grippy tires. my previous ones had been on for a few years, and were not great with slick conditions. not good for my daily
		commuter! while i was out, i dropped a few books at the libary- i had hoped to pick up a hold as well, but it didn't occur to me that it was mlk day until it was too late. alas, a nice ride anyways. i stopped
		at a thrift shop on my way back in hopes of getting lucky with a backpack, to no avail. recently, i've been infatuated with the <a href="https://www.tombihn.com/products/synapse-25?variant=31746869854271" title="external link!">tom
		bihn synapse 25</a>. i didn't expect to find one at the shop (they retail secondhand for $150+. real easy to sell!), but maybe something else would do. it's always nice to pop in anyways, so no harm.</td>

		<td>got warm pretty quick! first time wearing my winter boots in weather this warm- feels like pushing against the upper limit. also had on wool socks
		and leggings, with my slim dungarees. sunshirt and nanoair jacket up top, with dual layered gloves, a merino buff, and my car talk hat. had to unzip my jacket
		pretty early on. yesterday was my first day back on the bike after a few weeks off, and it certainly <i>felt</i> like i could feel it, though part of that was an
		underinflated tire and a headwind. was running late on my way in, and could feel myself getting annoyed about navigating through the snow and slush and ice. have
		to give myself time to enjoy it!</td>
