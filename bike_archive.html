		<td>notes:</td>
		<td>our car broke down on 02.25 and was out of commission for a whole week. this, along with the fact that there was no snowfall or poorly timed rain pushing me toward the bus, meant i rode my 
		bike to work everyday! it was great. i could definitely feel it at the end though. thrilled that i had it in me, and looking forward to pedaling with more regularity. went back to rolling with
		the panniers, it's just nice to not have something hanging on my back. skipped the wool leggings a couple days, i think 35 and above is really doable for me. it's always interesting to see the differences in
		how i dress for 40 degreesin october vs how I dress for 40 degrees in february or march.</td>

		<td>had a free day on monday! felt like moving around, so i hopped on my ride and hit the north branch trail for a bit. a lot of it was really smooth going, but there were occasional long stretches of ice that was fun to traverse. did bump into my old regular tim, which was a treat! love little meetings like that, when it's people i like. very pleasant ride overall.</td>

		<td>i am running out of novel things to say about these commutes! this was the first time in a long time i rode with a back pack tho- was nice to feel faster on the bike (no panniers), but there's definitely a back sweat penalty. have to think about how i want to proceed! really, i'm hoping to find a way to set up a front basket soon, and i can deposit the bag in there, but it's a tougher set up with my current ride. when i get a new bike, definitely tho!!</td>

		<td>first time back on after a week of bussing and driving- felt good to move again! hopefully the weather will allow me to keep it up. saw a guy pedaling last friday when we'd just gotten 6" of snow and i was jealous! i'm not set up for that currently, my bike couldn't handle it.</td>

		<td>warmed up quick on my way in, and the way home was sunny and 15 degrees warmer! glad i could swap to just a shell with minimal insulation. chatted with a fella on the way back for a bit- he used to have a similar bike to mine, back when they were new. we talked about riding year round- he's a pleasure rider who won't go below twenty five degrees, and he has electric socks! electric socks! good for him for having a limit and being able to enjoy it. he did say he was pretty cold today while i was actively trying to go slow so i wouldn't sweat, but we were dressed pretty differently. wish my workplace wasn't kept so warm- it gets annoying wearing baselayers to stay warm on my commute, but then being too warm throughout the day. before it got real cold and they cranked the heat, i was comfy dressed in layers!! alas, better this than come cps instances where they have no heat. :( </td>

		<td>tri-purpose ride! i put new <a href="https://www.continental-tires.com/bicycle/tires/urban-tour/ride-tour" title="external link!">tires</a> on my bike, and this was the inagural//test ride.
		they work fine! i feel a little more confident in wintery conditions with some new grippy tires. my previous ones had been on for a few years, and were not great with slick conditions. not good for my daily
		commuter! while i was out, i dropped a few books at the libary- i had hoped to pick up a hold as well, but it didn't occur to me that it was mlk day until it was too late. alas, a nice ride anyways. i stopped
		at a thrift shop on my way back in hopes of getting lucky with a backpack, to no avail. recently, i've been infatuated with the <a href="https://www.tombihn.com/products/synapse-25?variant=31746869854271" title="external link!">tom
		bihn synapse 25</a>. i didn't expect to find one at the shop (they retail secondhand for $150+. real easy to sell!), but maybe something else would do. it's always nice to pop in anyways, so no harm.</td>

		<td>got warm pretty quick! first time wearing my winter boots in weather this warm- feels like pushing against the upper limit. also had on wool socks
		and leggings, with my slim dungarees. sunshirt and nanoair jacket up top, with dual layered gloves, a merino buff, and my car talk hat. had to unzip my jacket
		pretty early on. yesterday was my first day back on the bike after a few weeks off, and it certainly <i>felt</i> like i could feel it, though part of that was an
		underinflated tire and a headwind. was running late on my way in, and could feel myself getting annoyed about navigating through the snow and slush and ice. have
		to give myself time to enjoy it!</td>
